==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::FindGrep - Posy plugin to find files using grep.


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.20'' of Posy::Plugin::FindGrep.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This plugin checks the 'find' parameter, and uses the 'grep' program to find
files which match the given regular expression. This requires a version of
'grep' which accepts the '-l' and '-r' arguments, which means that this
plugin will not work on all systems even if they have a 'grep' command.

This fills in a few variables which can be used withing your flavour
templates.

$flow_findgrep_form
Contains a search-form definition for setting the 'find' parameter.

$flow_find
Contains the search parameter only if a search was done -- that is, the
*legal* search parameter. This may be preferred to be used rather than
$param_find in your flavour template files.

$flow_num_found
The number of entries which were found which matched the search parameter.


==   Activation   ==

This plugin needs to be added to the plugins list and the actions list.
Since this overrides the 'select_by_path' method, care needs to be taken
with other plugins if they override the same method.

In the actions list 'findgrep_set' needs to go somewhere after
``head_template'' and before ``head_render'', since this needs to set values
before the head is rendered.


==   Configuration   ==

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash, which, in
the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config" file in the
config directory.

``findgrep_use_egrep''
Use egrep instead of grep. (default: false)


==== REQUIRES ====

    Test::More
    grep
