Revision history for Posy-Plugin-FindGrep
=========================================

0.23 Fri 13 May 2005
--------------------

  * (13 May 2005) make things work better with hybrid sites
  	Added 'findgrep_url' config variable, and changed the form,
  so that for hybrid sites, the CGI script will still be called, even
  if this form is called from a static page.
  	This doesn't work with the Canonical plugin, though.

0.22 Thu 12 May 2005
--------------------

  * (12 May 2005) update Posy version

  * (12 May 2005) add Makefile.PL

0.21 Sun 06 February 2005
-------------------------

  * (6 Feb 2005) added INSTALL docs

0.20 Fri 28 January 2005
------------------------

  * (28 Jan 2005) findgrep_use_egrep option
  	Added a config option to enable the use of egrep instead
  of grep, if the user so chooses.

  * (28 Jan 2005) changed the search label
  	Since it has a different behaviour depending on whether it
  is at the top of the site or in a subdir, thought I should change the
  'Search' label to reflect this.
