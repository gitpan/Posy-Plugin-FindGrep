Revision history for Posy-Plugin-FindGrep
=========================================

------------------------

  * (28 Jan 2005) findgrep_use_egrep option
  	Added a config option to enable the use of egrep instead
  of grep, if the user so chooses.

  * (28 Jan 2005) changed the search label
  	Since it has a different behaviour depending on whether it
  is at the top of the site or in a subdir, thought I should change the
  'Search' label to reflect this.
